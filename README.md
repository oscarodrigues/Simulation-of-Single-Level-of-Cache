# Simulation-of-Single-Level-of-Cache

In this project, I:

• Designed a 32-bit caching system with user-defined architecture parameters using MATLAB.

• Built then-way set associative cache to be capable of both read and write operations.

• Measured cache performance by comparing total cycles, RAM size, hit ratio, and write-backs.

To run the program, open MATLAB and ensure that all the files are within the same directory. Then, just hit run and a simulation will report back with the analysis.

There are 64k, 256k, and 1M variants but the file sizes were too big for GitHub. If you have any more questions, feel free to message me!
